                "instruction": "There is a high risk of rip currents.\n\nRip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away\nfrom shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the\nsandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins, jetties\nand piers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current, yell for help. Remain\ncalm, do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.",

River ice spotters are asked to report any\nice jams or ice jam flooding. Any ice jam that develops will have\nthe potential to cause rises on area rivers with little to no\nwarning and isolated areas of flooding are possible.\n\nThis outlook means that elevated water levels and potential impacts\nare possible, but not yet certain. Persons along area rivers should\ncontinue to monitor the latest forecasts over the next week.",
