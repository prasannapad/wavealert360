I lost 2 close family members in a rip current beach accident in Jan 2025. I would like to create an alerting system that can be easily installed at the entrace to beaches that welcome the public and audible alerts about beach conditions on that day such as rip currents, beach hazards, high surf, sneaker waves etc. Awareness will hopefully save lives. Please contact me at ppadmana@gmail.com if you want to collaborate with me.
