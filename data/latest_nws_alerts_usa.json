If you don't have home air conditioning, continue\nto seek out cool spaces each day as long as it remains hot, and for\na few days after if your home is still hot. Check on vulnerable\nfriends, family members and neighbors.\n\nTo reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks in\nshaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by heat\nshould be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke is an\nemergency! In cases of heat stroke call 9 1 1.",

People who may be especially sensitive to the effects of\nelevated levels of pollutants include the very young, and those with\npreexisting respiratory problems such as asthma or heart disease.\nThose with symptoms should consider consulting their personal\nphysician.\n\nA toll free air quality hotline has been established so New York\nresidents can stay informed on the air quality situation. The toll\nfree number is 1 800 5 3 5, 1 3 4 5.",
